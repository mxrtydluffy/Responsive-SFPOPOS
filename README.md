My name is Arjay and one of my top hobbies is traveling! Living in the Philippines my entire life San Francisco has been one of my top places in my bucket list. Other than the Golden State Bridge, Painted Ladies, and Twin Peaks I wanted to know other locations that will catch my attention. Instagram has been my main source of insight but I wanted to find a website that will feed on my curiosity. After a couple of hours of browsing on my desktop I found SFPOPOS and got excited! The pictures were clean and organized and once I clicked on one of them it had a short brief description of the location. There were some cute emojis which was also good to know. I then searched up the location on another browser and found its near the hotel I planned to stay along with other popular sushi places my siblings and I are craving! Definately bookmarking this website to see future feature updates!

As a junior nursing student there are three things I love - helping people, fighting for social justice, and of course coffee!! After clinicals my group and I made it a habit to try various coffee shops as much as we can. We used the map on our iphones to discover different places however the pictures were limited and I don't want to open a yelp account. After doing research on my phone I found SFPOPOS. Once I saw the list of places it caught my attention of the layout of the photos and its detail. I liked there was a pick a random space button that led me to different interesting attractions I never knew about! However, once I went to the about page I began to ask questions of the authenticity of the website. Its no doubt the website is well built but I wanted to see more of what the develor would create since we have the same taste in sceneries and aesthesics. If applicable, a linkedin would be great and maybe there are other topics that will open doors to my fascination. I am also a boba addict and frozen yogurt person as well. Looking forward to seeing the future updates of the website.

Every weekend I like treating myself to hot coffee while reviewing for my accounting homework. Me being the adventerous person I am one day my taste buds wanted to try something different. Before I went to bed I was searching coffee shops in San Francisco but I eventaully got tired going to each individual coffee shop website and prefered to see a list of nearby locations. When I found SFPOPOS I saw there were emojis like a plug in charger, coffee and a tree! This website met my needs since it had a random space button that made me screen shot each individual place. Now at the end of the day once I visited one of the places I feel like one emoji can be implemented that is vital for anyone to know and that is parking. Usually the coffee shops I attend to have decent amount of parking yet the one I visited had nonexistent spaces. I ended up paying at a local garage which was quite a walk but on the bright side I got good scenery and a delicious ube latte. Hopefully some more emojis can be implemented yet I can say for sure the location description is factual.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
